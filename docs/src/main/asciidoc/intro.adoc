This project provides Netflix OSS integrations for Spring Boot apps through autoconfiguration
and binding to the Spring Environment and other Spring programming model idioms. With a few
simple annotations you can quickly enable and configure the common patterns inside your
application and build large distributed systems with battle-tested Netflix components. The 
patterns provided include Service Discovery (Eureka), Circuit Breaker (Hystrix), 
Intelligent Routing (Zuul) and Client Side Load Balancing (Ribbon).
