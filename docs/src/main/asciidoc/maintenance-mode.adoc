== Modules In Maintenance Mode

Placing a module in maintenance mode means that the Spring Cloud team will no longer be adding new features to the module.
We will fix blocker bugs and security issues, and we will also consider and review small pull requests from the community.

We intend to continue to support these modules for a period of at least a year from the general availability
of the Greenwich release train.

The following Spring Cloud Netflix modules and corresponding starters will be placed into maintenance mode:

* spring-cloud-netflix-archaius
* spring-cloud-netflix-concurrency-limits
* spring-cloud-netflix-hystrix-contract
* spring-cloud-netflix-hystrix-dashboard
* spring-cloud-netflix-hystrix-stream
* spring-cloud-netflix-hystrix
* spring-cloud-netflix-ribbon
* spring-cloud-netflix-turbine-stream
* spring-cloud-netflix-turbine
* spring-cloud-netflix-zuul

NOTE: This does not include the Eureka modules.
