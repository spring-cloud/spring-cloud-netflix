|Name | Default | Description

|eureka.client.allow-redirects | `+++false+++` | Indicates whether server can redirect a client request to a backup server/cluster. If set to false, the server will handle the request directly, If set to true, it may send HTTP redirect to the client, with a new server location.
|eureka.client.availability-zones |  | Gets the list of availability zones (used in AWS data centers) for the region in which this instance resides. The changes are effective at runtime at the next registry fetch cycle as specified by registryFetchIntervalSeconds.

The changes are effective at runtime.
|eureka.client.eureka-service-url-poll-interval-seconds | `+++0+++` | Indicates how often(in seconds) to poll for changes to eureka server information. Eureka servers could be added or removed and this setting controls how soon the eureka clients should know about it.

After receiving the deltas, eureka client reconciles the information from the server to verify it has not missed out some information. Reconciliation failures could happen when the client has had network issues communicating to server.If the reconciliation fails, eureka client gets the full registry information.

|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.cache.enabled | `+++true+++` | Enables Spring Cloud LoadBalancer caching mechanism.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.cache.ttl | `+++35s+++` | Time To Live - time counted from writing of the record, after which cache entries are expired, expressed as a {@link Duration}. The property {@link String} has to be in keeping with the appropriate syntax as specified in Spring Boot <code>StringToDurationConverter</code>. @see <a href= "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/convert/StringToDurationConverter.java">StringToDurationConverter.java</a>
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.call-get-with-request-on-delegates | `+++true+++` | If this flag is set to {@code true}, {@code ServiceInstanceListSupplier#get(Request request)} method will be implemented to call {@code delegate.get(request)} in classes assignable from {@code DelegatingServiceInstanceListSupplier} that don't already implement that method, with the exclusion of {@code CachingServiceInstanceListSupplier} and {@code HealthCheckServiceInstanceListSupplier}, which should be placed in the instance supplier hierarchy directly after the supplier performing instance retrieval over the network, before any request-based filtering is done, {@code true} by default.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.clients |  |
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.configurations | `+++default+++` | Enables a predefined LoadBalancer configuration.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.eager-load.clients |  | Names of the clients.

|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.health-check.interval | `+++25s+++` | Interval for rerunning the HealthCheck scheduler.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.health-check.interval  | `+++25s+++` | Interval for rerunning the HealthCheck scheduler.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.health-check.path |  | Path at which the health-check request should be made. Can be set up per `serviceId`. A `default` value can be set up as well. If none is set up, `/actuator/health` will be used.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.health-check.port |  | Path at which the health-check request should be made. If none is set, the port under which the requested service is available at the service instance.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.health-check.refetch-instances | `+++false+++` | Indicates whether the instances should be refetched by the `HealthCheckServiceInstanceListSupplier`. This can be used if the instances can be updated and the underlying delegate does not provide an ongoing flux.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.health-check.refetch-instances-interval | `+++25s+++` | Interval for refetching available service instances.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.health-check.repeat-health-check | `+++true+++` | Indicates whether health checks should keep repeating. It might be useful to set it to `false` if periodically refetching the instances, as every refetch will also trigger a healthcheck.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.health-check.update-results-list | `+++true+++` | Indicates whether the {@code healthCheckFlux} should emit on each alive {@link ServiceInstance} that has been retrieved. If set to {@code false}, the entire alive instances sequence is first collected into a list and only then emitted.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.hint |  | Allows setting the value of <code>hint</code> that is passed on to the LoadBalancer request and can subsequently be used in {@link ReactiveLoadBalancer} implementations.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.hint-header-name | `+++X-SC-LB-Hint+++` | Allows setting the name of the header used for passing the hint for hint-based service instance filtering.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.retry.avoid-previous-instance | `+++true+++` | Enables wrapping ServiceInstanceListSupplier beans with `RetryAwareServiceInstanceListSupplier` if Spring-Retry is in the classpath.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.retry.backoff.enabled | `+++false+++` | Indicates whether Reactor Retry backoffs should be applied.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.retry.backoff.jitter | `+++0.5+++` | Used to set `RetryBackoffSpec.jitter`.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.retry.backoff.max-backoff | `+++Long.MAX ms+++` | Used to set `RetryBackoffSpec.maxBackoff`.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.retry.backoff.min-backoff | `+++5 ms+++` | Used to set `RetryBackoffSpec#minBackoff`.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.retry.enabled | `+++true+++` | Enables LoadBalancer retries.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.retry.max-retries-on-next-service-instance | `+++1+++` | Number of retries to be executed on the next `ServiceInstance`. A `ServiceInstance` is chosen before each retry call.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.retry.max-retries-on-same-service-instance | `+++0+++` | Number of retries to be executed on the same `ServiceInstance`.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.retry.retry-on-all-exceptions | `+++false+++` | Indicates retries should be attempted for all exceptions, not only those specified in `retryableExceptions`.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.retry.retry-on-all-operations | `+++false+++` | Indicates retries should be attempted on operations other than `HttpMethod.GET`.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.retry.retryable-exceptions | `+++{}+++` | A `Set` of `Throwable` classes that should trigger a retry.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.retry.retryable-status-codes | `+++{}+++` | A `Set` of status codes that should trigger a retry.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.service-discovery.timeout |  | String representation of Duration of the timeout for calls to service discovery.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.stats.micrometer.enabled | `+++false+++` | Enables Spring Cloud LoadBalancer Micrometer stats.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.sticky-session.add-service-instance-cookie | `+++false+++` | Indicates whether a cookie with the newly selected instance should be added by LoadBalancer.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.sticky-session.instance-id-cookie-name | `+++sc-lb-instance-id+++` | The name of the cookie holding the preferred instance id.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.subset.instance-id |  | Instance id of deterministic subsetting. If not set, {@link IdUtils#getDefaultInstanceId(PropertyResolver)} will be used.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.subset.size | `+++100+++` | Max subset size of deterministic subsetting.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.x-forwarded.enabled | `+++false+++` | To Enable X-Forwarded Headers.
|spring.cloud.loadbalancer.zone |  | Spring Cloud LoadBalancer zone.
|spring.cloud.refresh.additional-property-sources-to-retain |  | Additional property sources to retain during a refresh. Typically only system property sources are retained. This property allows property sources, such as property sources created by EnvironmentPostProcessors to be retained as well.
|spring.cloud.refresh.enabled | `+++true+++` | Enables autoconfiguration for the refresh scope and associated features.
|spring.cloud.refresh.extra-refreshable | `+++true+++` | Additional class names for beans to post process into refresh scope.
|spring.cloud.refresh.never-refreshable | `+++true+++` | Comma separated list of class names for beans to never be refreshed or rebound.
