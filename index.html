{% capture billboard_description %}

Spring Cloud Netflix provides Netflix OSS integrations for Spring Boot apps through autoconfiguration and binding to the Spring Environment and other Spring programming model idioms. With a few simple annotations you can quickly enable and configure the common patterns inside your application and build large distributed systems with battle-tested Netflix components. The patterns provided include Service Discovery (Eureka), Circuit Breaker (Hystrix), Intelligent Routing (Zuul) and Client Side Load Balancing (Ribbon)..

## Features

Spring Cloud Netflix features:

* Service Discovery: Eureka instances can be registered and clients can discover the instances using Spring-managed beans
* Service Discovery: an embedded Eureka server can be created with declarative Java configuration
* Circuit Breaker: Hystrix clients can be built with a simple annotation-driven method decorator
* Circuit Breaker: embedded Hystrix dashboard with declarative Java configuration
* Declarative REST Client: Feign creates a dynamic implementation of an interface decorated with JAX-RS or Spring MVC annotations
* Client Side Load Balancer: Ribbon
* External Configuration: a bridge from the Spring Environment to Archaius (enables native configuration of Netflix components using Spring Boot conventions)
* Router and Filter: automatic regsitration of Zuul filters, and a simple convention over configuration approach to reverse proxy creation

## Quick Start

{% include download_widget.md %}

As long as Spring Cloud Netflix and Eureka Core are on the
classpath any Spring Boot application with `@EnableEurekaClient` will try to contact a Eureka
server on `http://localhost:8761` (the default value of
`eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone`):

```java
@Configuration
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@EnableEurekaClient
@RestController
public class Application {

  @RequestMapping("/")
  public String home() {
    return "Hello World";
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
  }

}
```

To run your own server use the `spring-cloud-starter-eureka-server` dependency and `@EnableEurekaServer`.
